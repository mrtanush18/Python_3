# Difference bw interface & abstract class (ABC):
All methods inside interface are abstract. In ABC atleast one method is concrete

In ABC, we don't know how those methods will be implemented by other classes hence we make that method abstract. ABC does not need a constructor except in inheritance as we cannot create object of abc


# Difference bw class & interface : 
In a class all methods are implemented. In an interface none of the methods are implemented. They have to be implemented by the class implementing it.

An instance of a class can be created, but not of an interface
