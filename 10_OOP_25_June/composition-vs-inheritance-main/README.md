In the first version (before.py), there is no inheritance, just three classes (= three employee types) with low cohesion (lots of responsibilities per class), and code duplication. 

Then there is a version that tries to solve those issues with inheritance (`with_inheritance.py`), and another version that uses composition (`with_composition.py`).
