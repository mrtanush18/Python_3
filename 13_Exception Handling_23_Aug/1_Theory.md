In python, an exception is a class that represents error.

Exceptions are unavoidable by developer so we try to handle these exceptions that might occur and disrupt the code flow.

If these exceptions are not handled, our application or programs go into a crash state.

Examples : depreciated packages, Blue screen, user inputs sth unexpected
