# Single inheritance 
> Single parent, single child

# Multiple Inheritance
> When a class can be derived from more than one base class
> Multiple parent, single child inherits from both

# Multiple Inheritance in Java
Multiple inheritance not supported in Java
Multiple interfaces in Java instead of multiple inheritance
Interfaces only in java : only method declarations

# Multilevel Inheritance :
> In multilevel inheritance, features of the base class and the derived class are further inherited into the new derived class.
> Grandfather, father, son classes

# Hybrid Inheritance : 
> Combination of multiple and multilevel
> In hybrid inheritance a diamond structure relationship is formed

        Grandparent class

Parent class 1      Parent class 2

           Child class

# Hierarchical Inheritance: 
> When more than one derived class are created from a single base
> Singel parent, multiple children. ex. person, doctor, carpenter classes

# Composition vs inheritance
> Use inheritance in : Is a relationship
> Use composition in : Has a relationship

> Ex. inheritance : ex. person > doctor > teacher , is of type
> Ex. composition : ex. car > engine is part of

> Inheritance : Inheriting a existing object's properties
> Composition : 2 classes, same as inheritance but are separate. 
There is a main or composite class, will create other classes

> Composition is better as less loc, more secure, easier to modify code
